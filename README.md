Automate the Boring Stuff with Python Book Exercises


This repository contains some exercises and projects code that I write while reading the book "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python".
The code might not be exactely the same as described in the book and I may add in other things.

The "Automate ..." is a great book and I read the original edition and in fact there is also a newer 2nd edition published at 2019.
Both are _free_ to read online on the [author's website](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/).
